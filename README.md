# Italy_background_inlabru
This repository contains code for reproducing the results described in the paper 'Developing a background seismicity model for operational earthquake forecasting in Italy', Bayliss, Naylor and Main, Geophysical Journal International, 2025. 
- The input folder contains the input data used to make the models
- The code folder contains R code for constructing earthquake forecasts using [inlabru](https://inlabru-org.github.io/inlabru/index.html) and a python notebook for testing forecasts with [pycsep](https://github.com/SCECcode/pycsep)
- The forecasts folder contains several different versions of the forecasts including different methods of declustering the input catalogues and using a fixed number of events as described in the paper.
